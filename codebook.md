The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities (Walking, Walking upstairs, Walking downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying).

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
